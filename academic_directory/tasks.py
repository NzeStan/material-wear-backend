Background Tasks for Academic Directory

This module bridges scheduled work to material/background_utils.py.
No Celery — uses threading for quick email tasks and
django-background-tasks for heavy periodic jobs.

Scheduled via management commands (see management/commands/):
  - run_graduation_check   → daily via cron
  - send_academic_summary  → daily via cron
  - process_academic_notifications → every 5-10 min via cron
